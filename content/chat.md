My current focus is on AI tools in production at [Flomni](https://flomni.com/en). Previously, I worked on AI at [Juro](https://juro.com), and ML at [Intento](https://inten.to).

I also help startups with product advising. Helping startups taught me that being a founder is incredibly hard, so I try to support founders in any way I can.

I graduated from [Southern Federal University](https://sfedu.ru/index_eng.php), where I studied Computer Science. I'm active on [GitHub](https://github.com/murabcd) and love seeing what others are building.

I frequently speak at events. Some recent talks include discussions on AI chatbots and voice applications in HR and CS.

I enjoy learning about interesting technical challenges and collaborating with great teams. [Reach out](mailto:murad.pmanager@gmail.com) if you want to find a way to work together!
