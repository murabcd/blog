## The Most Neglected Part of Strategy

Pricing is one of the most powerful, and most poorly handled, aspects of product strategy. In many organizations, it’s a chaotic process driven by the loudest voice in the room, a panicked reaction to a competitor's move, or a debate over which features belong in which tier. This is a recipe for leaving money on the table, alienating customers, and failing to capture the true value of your product.

A sustainable pricing strategy isn't a dark art; it's a discipline. It requires moving beyond guesswork and gut feelings to a structured framework that connects what your customers value to how your business grows. This is the framework I use to guide my teams and ensure our pricing is a strategic asset, not an accidental liability.

## 1. Anchor on Your Value Metric

The first and most important question is: what are customers *really* paying for? The answer to this is your **value metric**. It is the single attribute of your product that customers value most and that scales as they find more success with it.

Your entire pricing model should be anchored to this metric. This isn't just about packaging features into tiers. It's about aligning your price with the core value you deliver. There are generally three ways to do this:

- **Feature-based:** Price scales as customers unlock more functionality. This is simple but can disconnect price from actual usage and value.
- **Usage-based:** Price scales with consumption (e.g., per user, per API call, per gigabyte of storage). This directly links cost to usage.
- **Outcome-based:** Price scales with the business impact the customer sees (e.g., percentage of revenue generated, cost saved). This is the hardest to implement but creates the strongest alignment.

Choosing the right value metric is the foundation of your entire strategy. Get this wrong, and every subsequent step will be built on a weak foundation.

## 2. Understand What the Market Will Bear

Once you’ve identified your value metric, you have a hypothesis. The next step is to test that hypothesis against market reality. You must move beyond internal opinions and find out what your customers are actually willing to pay.

Guesswork is not a strategy. The real work here involves structured research to understand the perceived value of your product. Methodologies like the Van Westendorp survey are designed for this, helping you identify a price range that is seen as neither "too cheap" (raising quality concerns) nor "too expensive" (creating a barrier to purchase).

This research must be segmented. A startup's willingness to pay is entirely different from an enterprise customer's. Their use cases, budgets, and alternatives are not the same. Your pricing must reflect these different realities. This data provides an essential, market-driven baseline that grounds your internal discussions in fact, not feeling.

## 3. Design for Growth, Not Just Revenue

A common mistake is to view pricing solely as a monetization tool. It is also one of your most powerful growth levers. An effective pricing strategy should reduce friction in your acquisition and retention loops, not add to it.

Consider the classic example of Zoom. If they had charged every new user to host a meeting, their upfront revenue would have been higher, but their viral growth would have been nonexistent. Their free plan wasn't just a marketing tactic; it was a core part of a deliberate growth strategy that removed friction from the "attendee becomes host" loop.

As a product leader, you must ask: how does our pricing model affect our ability to acquire new customers? How does it encourage them to deepen their engagement? Does it create barriers or pathways to expansion? Sometimes, the most profitable decision in the long run is to make something free in the short run.

## 4. The Unit Economics Must Work

A pricing model that customers love but that isn't profitable is a failed strategy. The fourth step is a crucial reality check to ensure the business is sustainable. You must understand your cost of revenue.

This boils down to two key numbers:

- **Cost to Acquire a Customer (CAC):** How much do you spend on sales and marketing to win a new account?
- **Cost to Serve a Customer (CTS):** What are the ongoing costs for infrastructure, support, and maintenance for that account?

The revenue you generate from a customer must significantly outweigh these costs. This leads to the most important metric of all: the **payback period**. How many months of revenue does it take to recoup your CAC?

A short payback period (e.g., under 12 months for a B2B SaaS business) means you have a healthy, efficient business model. A long payback period means your company's cash flow is at risk, and you may not be able to retain customers long enough to ever turn a profit. The math has to work.

## 5. Treat Pricing as a Product, Not a Project

Finally, pricing is never "done." The market changes, your product evolves, and your customers' needs shift. Your pricing strategy must be agile enough to adapt.

This means treating pricing like any other part of your product. It should be subject to testing, iteration, and continuous improvement. Form a clear hypothesis ("We believe increasing the price of our Pro plan by 15% will increase ARPU without significantly impacting churn") and then design a controlled A/B test to measure the results.

Look beyond a single success metric. A price change can affect conversion, expansion revenue, retention, and customer satisfaction. You need to measure the impact across the entire system. This iterative approach ensures your pricing remains optimized over time, rather than becoming a static relic of past assumptions.

## Conclusion

Pricing is one of the highest-leverage activities a product organization can undertake. It demands a blend of customer empathy, rigorous data analysis, and sound business judgment. By moving away from ad-hoc decisions and embracing a structured framework, you can turn your pricing model into a powerful engine for sustainable growth. Pricing isn't just a number on a page; it's the most concise expression of your product's value.
