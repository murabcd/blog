This week, I spoke at the [MK Conference](https://www.mk-conference.ru/ai) about a critical shift in recruitment technology: moving past the limitations of simple bots.

My talk, titled **"AI-assistant â‰  bot,"** argued that the true value of AI in HR isn't just automation, but augmentation. I shared a case study of how a large banking client is using Flomni's AI as a co-pilot in their hiring process. We highlighted key aspects of the project:

- **The Challenge:** Recruiters were spending too much time on manual screening for complex roles, unable to focus on high-value candidate engagement and strategic decisions.
- **Our Approach:** Instead of a simple filter, we implemented an AI co-pilot. It engages candidates in dynamic conversations to assess not just technical fit, but also soft skills, motivation, and cultural alignment.
- **The Outcome:** The approach led to a **63%** increase in interview show-ups and a **69%** decrease in lost candidates.

The core idea is that the best technology doesn't replace a recruiter's expertise, but rather amplifies it. By providing a powerful 'co-pilot' to handle deep analysis and initial interactions, we free up recruiters to focus on what they do best: building relationships and making final hiring decisions.

The discussions after the talk confirmed the industry is ready to move beyond basic automation toward more collaborative AI.
