This week, I spoke at the [MK Conference](https://www.mk-conference.ru/ai) about a critical shift in recruitment technology: moving past the limitations of simple bots.

My talk, titled **"AI-assistant ≠ bot,"** argued that the true value of AI in HR isn't just automation, but augmentation. I shared a case study of how a large banking client is using Flomni's AI as a co-pilot in their hiring process.

The journey began when a major banking client approached us with a familiar problem: their recruiters were drowning in manual screening tasks. But what made this case different was their willingness to think beyond simple automation.

Instead of asking "How can we replace recruiters?" they asked "How can we make our recruiters 10x more effective?"

The breakthrough came when we shifted from thinking about AI as a replacement to thinking about it as a co-pilot. Our AI doesn't just filter candidates—it engages them in dynamic conversations that assess technical fit, soft skills, motivation, and cultural alignment.

This approach led to remarkable results: **63%** increase in interview show-ups and a **69%** decrease in lost candidates.

The core insight is that the best technology doesn't replace a recruiter's expertise, but rather amplifies it. By providing a powerful 'co-pilot' to handle deep analysis and initial interactions, we free up recruiters to focus on what they do best: building relationships and making final hiring decisions.

The discussions after the talk confirmed the industry is ready to move beyond basic automation toward more collaborative AI.
