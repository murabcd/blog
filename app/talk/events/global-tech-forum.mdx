It was a fantastic experience presenting at the [Global Tech Forum](https://globaltechforum.ru/march2025) on March 21st, 2025. I had the opportunity to discuss Flomni's successful collaboration with Ural Airlines in leveraging AI to enhance their customer service.

Our talk focused on how Flomni's solutions addressed the challenges faced by a major airline like Ural Airlines, which handles millions of passengers yearly.

Ural Airlines was relying heavily on phone support - costly, often inconvenient for customers, and difficult to scale. With millions of passengers yearly, the traditional approach was becoming unsustainable.

We implemented a phased approach with Flomni's chatbot platform, starting with basic automation and evolving to include AI and deep integrations with Ural Airlines' systems.

The results speak for themselves: **63%** of customer inquiries are now automated, with service costs reduced by **25%**.

We also touched upon how AI continues to evolve customer support, mentioning other Flomni's AI assistants, which assists humans in real-time to improve efficiency and service quality.

Presenting this case study was a great way to showcase the practical application of AI in solving real-world business problems. The positive results achieved with Ural Airlines demonstrate the significant impact intelligent automation can have on large-scale customer service operations.

It was rewarding to share these insights and engage with the audience at GTF 2025. Looking forward to more opportunities to discuss the future of AI.
